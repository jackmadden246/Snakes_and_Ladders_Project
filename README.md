This is my Snakes and Ladders game. I received inspiration for this project from some code I found online, which I've been adapting and changing to make it into what I want it to be. I want to make the game interactive for the user through having random comments being generated about the player's progress. This is particularly important for me as I did not want to create a boring game. This is part 1 of my project. Part 2 will be in two parts: AWS and a database. I hope to add the game to AWS Lambda, and try to host the game online. This will be so I could measure and obtain some user-generated metrics, which I can then store in a database.
