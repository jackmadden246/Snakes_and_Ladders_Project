SNAKES AND LADDERS GAME
Created 01.12.2022
RULE:
A player will enter the game only if they get 1 on the dice.
After that, if the player gets the number n in the dice, they move forward n boxes
If there is a ladder in the square the player is currently in, they move to the square where the ladder ends
If there is a snake in the square the player is currently in, they move to the square with the tail of the snake.
